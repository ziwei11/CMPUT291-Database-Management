Good job. She not only quickly finished her part, did a good job on her solo ER-model and mapping, but also gave us some instruction about how to use Dia app. She also helped me a lot with my solo ED-model.

Good job. Ziwei drew a very complete ER diagram and gave more reasonable relationships of the vote entity. In the group discussion, she gave us some useful advice which gave us a lot of inspiration.


2. Comments on Bingran(CCID: bingran1):
Well done. Bingranâ€™s ER diagram is really logical and gave many details which made the group diagram better. He was also very active in the group discussion and provided a lot of good ideas.

She did a great job on her solo ER-model, her solo is complete enough and the structure is clear enough. During the group discussion, she provided many useful and reasonable ideas to our final ER-model and the mapping.


2. Comments on Weixi(CCID: weixi):
She also did a good job on her own model. She always reminded us when we forget
some important detail such as the arrow between two entities and the she provided
enough evidence to prove that we should put an arrow there.
